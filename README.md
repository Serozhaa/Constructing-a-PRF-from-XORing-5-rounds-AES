# Constructing-a-PRF-from-XORing-5-rounds-AES

This github contains all the scripts used for my thesis to construct a PRF from XORing 5 rounds AES, measure the performance and perform differential cryptanalysis on it. The improved directory contains all the files for the base PRF, while the variations tab is not directly included in the thesis. Only the performance measurements of these variations are including as .svg files in the paper.
